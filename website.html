            The KCC library is the leading library body representing the interests of library and information services and their users.
            It is the national voice of the library and information profession. Libraries are rightly called the store house of valuable knowledge.
              The library has a separate reading section, reference section and stacking section.
               The unmatched quality and quantity  of material available is also supplemented by courteous and competent staff for facilitating students.
               The institute has constituted a separate library committee that selects and ensures the regular availability 
               of latest books and reading material in the library. 
               The provision of open access e-resource through internet no longer confines a student to the library only. The library at KCC is well equipped and has an immense collection 
               of resources in form of CD-ROM, online database, books, audio/video CDs, reference books, national and international
                periodicals, magazines, journals and pool of research work of eminent scholars.</p>
